<h2>Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#overview" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The submission and moderation subsystem provides:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Accession of submission of publication content and metadata via multiple
interfaces, including interfaces provided by trusted third-party platforms;</li>
<li>Quality assurance tools and workflows to screen submissions (moderation);</li>
<li>An extensible system for automating parts of the moderation process;</li>
<li>An event-based log of all submission and moderation activity related
associated with a paper.</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, the submission and moderation subsystem is responsible for all
submission-related activities up to (but not including) publication.</p>
<div class="section" id="typical-workflow">
<h3>Typical workflow<a class="headerlink" href="#typical-workflow" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Submitters (and external services) generate new submissions, which are
comprised of metadata and a content object (e.g. a tar/gzipped TeX source
bundle, or a single PDF file). Prior to consideration by moderators,
submissions may undergo several rounds of modification. Submitters may revise
metadata and/or upload revised content. During this process a handful of
different services may need to operate on the submission. For example,
the content is compiled into an arXiv PDF; links are extracted
for consideration by the submitter; etc.</p>
<p>Upon submission, the paper may be subject to a variety of processing and
moderation activities. Automatic classification algorithms may be run, which
require pre-processing steps (e.g. plain text extraction). Moderators may
propose re-classification, act on input from classification algorithms, make
comments, etc. Depending on moderator activity, additional input from the
submitter and/or administrators may be necessary.</p>

<div class="section" id="separation-of-concerns">
<h3>Separation of concerns<a class="headerlink" href="#separation-of-concerns" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In the classic arXiv submission system, there is tight coupling between the
submission and a variety of related objects and processes. For example,
processes like TeX compilation, auto-classification, etc are integrated with
web controllers for the submission UI. A major benefit of this approach is that
it keeps operations close together in the submission workflow. A major drawback
is its relative inflexibility: developing any one component of the submission
system risks generating cascading effects to other components, and assumptions
about the implementation details of components are baked into the system.</p>
<p>One of the major shifts in the NG reimplementation of the submission system is
to pull some of those components apart into self-contained services with
clearly-defined APIs. Our goal is to limit coupling to where it really matters,
and open the door to exchangeability of those components. This should make it
easier to develop individual components without breaking the whole system, and
also make it easier to respond to changing operational policies and procedures.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference internal" href="#utility-services"><span class="std std-ref">Utility services</span></a> section describes some of the backend components
that will be “compartmentalized” as stand-alone services in NG.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="commands-events-as-data">
<h3>Commands (events) as data<a class="headerlink" href="#commands-events-as-data" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The classic arXiv submission system is built around an object-centric data
model. Submissions are represented objects whose properties map to rows in a
database table, and workflows are implemented by developing web controllers
that mutate those objects (and the underlying rows). In order to support
administrative requirements of visibility onto activity in the submission
system, a log is updated by those controllers whenever they are executed.
Conditional operations are implemented by adding procedures to those
controllers. This model works well for simple systems in which there is a
single point of entry for submission data: each controller is solely
responsible for a command or set of commands, and so coupling between user
request handling/views and the commands themselves (along with conditional
operations linked to those commands) is not problematic.</p>
<p>A requirement of arXiv-NG is to provide consistent support for evolving and
potentially many accession pathways into arXiv. A limitation of the classic
architecture is that it requires new submission interfaces to reimplement the
commands (and rules) that it exposes, and to reimplement updates to the
administrative log. In the NG submission system, commands (and log updates)
are independent of the interface controllers – this allows for a greater
deal of flexibility when implementing or changing interfaces. We can achieve
this either by implementing a command controller as standalone service that
handles commands from other applications, or by implementing a software package
that exposes commands as an internal API (arXiv-lib could be seen as an
attempt in that direction, although it is somewhat defeated by its broad scope
and leakage of business logic).</p>
<p>Another major requirement of arXiv-NG is to support triggers and automated
processes that can be configured by administrators, in addition to continuing
to support to the administrative log. A step in this direction would be to
include hooks for triggers behind the command API (above), and load parameters
(e.g. set in a database or a configuration file by an admin) that control
whether/how the trigger is executed. This has the potential to not scale well,
however, as the kinds of triggers and automation required must be anticipated
ahead of time and semi-hard-coded into the system. An alternative approach (the
one adopted here) is to define a set of primitives that explicitly represent
commands and rules, and build interfaces that allow them to be combined
arbitrarily to build workflows. In this approach, instances of command
execution (events) themselves are treated as data. This meets the requirements
of maintaining a high-fidelity comprehensive activity log.</p>
<p>A knock-on benefit of treating command execution/events as data is that it
allows for freer evolution of how we represent submission objects. If event
data are treated as the primary source of truth, the representation of the
submission itself can be treated as a secondary and somewhat disposable
projection. In the short term, as we reimplement components of the submission
system, we will need to guarantee that we generate projections in the classic
submission database that satisfy the requirements of legacy components that
have not yet been reimplemented. For example, when implementing a new
submission UI for NG we can collect and store new forms of data about a
submission in the event data (e.g. data used to populate new metadata fields),
but must also ensure that the appropriate tables in the classic database are
kept up-to-date for the sake of the classic moderation system. In the longer
term, projections of event data can be used to support efficient queries, but
do not constrain the evolution of the submission system in other areas.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id1">
<h3>Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#id1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li>We will decouple most functional components of the classic submission system
into independent services that are agnostic about submissions. This includes
classification, overlap detection, compilation (TeX, PS), and upload/file
management.</li>
<li>We will implement a <a class="reference internal" href="#submission-core-events-package"><span class="std std-ref">Python package</span></a>
that is responsible for all commands in the scope of the submission system.
That package should:<ul>
<li>Define the commands that are available in the submission system, and
provide a Python API for executing those commands.</li>
<li>Provide an API for defining rules and conditional operations based on those
commands.</li>
<li>Be responsible for updating the core submission database. It should persist
command execution instances/events in the core database, and also generate
projections of submission state that support query/read operations and
that are compatible with legacy components.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A set of <a class="reference internal" href="#interface-services"><span class="std std-ref">core submission interface services</span></a>
will provide UIs and APIs to support various submission and moderation
workflows. Those services will utilize the the core command/event package
(above).</li>

<div class="section" id="authenticated-users">
<h3>Authenticated users<a class="headerlink" href="#authenticated-users" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Authenticated users submit new publications via a user interface. Users can
view the status of their submissions, which may include feedback from
administrators, and amend their submissions as necessary. They
can also view a preview of their submission, and make amendments to the source
files in their submission directly via the interface. Authors can supplement
their published and unpublished submissions with links to external resources.</p>
<p>Moderators (authenticated users with a moderator role) screen and curate
submissions through a moderation interface. They can generate comments, flags,
proposals, and other annotations attached to submissions.</p>
<p>Administrators can audit and manage the submission platform, including the
behavior of automated processes and policies, through an administrative

</div>
<div class="section" id="api-access">
<h3>API access<a class="headerlink" href="#api-access" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>All API access passes through the arXiv API gateway.</p>
<p>The submission system provides a RESTful API for programmatic use. Clients may
deposit submissions in bulk (e.g. conference proceedings), or on an individual
basis on behalf of arXiv users. Authenticated arXiv users must explicitly
authorize external API clients to deposit on their behalf. The submission
system offers a webhook notification service that pushes updates in
submission state to authorized API clients.</p>
<p>A variety of backend services are exposed via the API gateway, including
the file management system (to facilitate upload), compilation services,
and classification services. Access to those services must be explicitly
authorized by administrators.</p>

<div class="section" id="other-arxiv-services">
<h3>Other arXiv services<a class="headerlink" href="#other-arxiv-services" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>During the daily publication process, the <span class="xref std std-ref">publication-agent</span> retrieves
information about publication-ready submissions. The publication agent moves
submission content and metadata into the appropriate storage facilities,
transitions the state of published submissions, and triggers downstream
processes via the notification broker.</p>
<p>Some processes in the submission system require information about past
arXiv papers. For example, classification, overlap detection, and other
QA/QC services will keep themselves up to date by consuming metadata and
content from published papers.</p>

<span id="id2"></span><h3>Submission database<a class="headerlink" href="#submission-database" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The submission database (currently MySQL) is responsible for the persistence of
operational and core descriptive metadata about submissions. Operational
metadata includes information related to arXiv workflows and processes. Core
descriptive metadata are the core publication metadata fields required for
arXiv submissions (e.g. title, authors, abstract). The primary source of truth
for the state of each submission is a set of transformation events. Derivative
representations (e.g. of submission objects) are also stored for querying and
rapid access.</p>
<p>In early phases of the classic renewal process, this will be the classic MySQL
database running in the CUL-IT datacenter. During the arXiv-NG project,
submission data will be migrated to a standalone MariaDB or PostgresQL cluster
in AWS RDS.</p>

<a class="reference internal" href="#submission-core-events-package"><span class="std std-ref">Submission core events package</span></a>.</p>
<p>Asynchronous operations (e.g. to execute rule-based logic) are performed by a
<a class="reference internal" href="#submission-worker"><span class="std std-ref">Submission worker</span></a> process. Communication between the interface services
and the worker is mediated by a task queue (Redis). Tasks passed on the queue

on submission data do so via this abstraction, which integrates with the
<a class="reference internal" href="#submission-database"><span class="std std-ref">Submission database</span></a>.</p>
<p>Rather than perform CRUD operations directly on submission objects, all
operations that modify submission data are performed through the creation of

operations that can be performed within the arXiv submission system, and a
starting-point for building rule-based workflows to support moderation and
administrative tasks.</p>
<p>This package also provides integration with a Kinesis notification broker,
which propagates notifications about events in real time to other services
in the arXiv system (e.g. the <a class="reference internal" href="#web-hook-service"><span class="std std-ref">Web-hook notification service</span></a>).</p>
