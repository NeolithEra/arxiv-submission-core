<h1>Submission &amp; moderation subsystem architecture<a class="headerlink" href="#submission-moderation-subsystem-architecture" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<div class="section" id="overview">
<h2>Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#overview" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The submission and moderation subsystem provides:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Accession of submission of publication content and metadata via multiple
interfaces, including interfaces provided by trusted third-party platforms;</li>
<li>Quality assurance tools and workflows to screen submissions (moderation);</li>
<li>An extensible system for automating parts of the moderation process;</li>
<li>An event-based log of all submission and moderation activity related
associated with a paper.</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, the submission and moderation subsystem is responsible for all
submission-related activities up to (but not including) publication.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="key-requirements">
<h2>Key requirements<a class="headerlink" href="#key-requirements" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>The system must sensibly incorporate input from, and synchronize the
activities of, a variety of human and non-human agents.</li>
<li>It must be possible for administrators to audit all state changes in the
system (e.g. by submitters, moderators, automated processes, etc).</li>
<li>Administrators must be able to configure automated rules and processes.</li>
<li>The system must support future development of potentially many alternative
interfaces for submission and moderation, including interfaces developed
and operated by trusted third-parties.</li>
<li>The system must be able to support a high volume of activity, potentially
two orders of magnitude greater than current levels (~11k submissions per
month in early 2018).</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="context">
<h2>Context<a class="headerlink" href="#context" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Authenticated users submit new publications via a user interface. Users can
view the status of their submissions, including feedback and interventions by
moderators and administrators, and amend their submissions as necessary. They
can also view a preview of their submission, and make amendments to the source
files in their submission. Authors can supplement their published and
unpublished submissions with links to external resources and other
supplemental metadata.</p>
<p>Moderators (authenticated users with a moderator role) screen and curate
submissions through a moderation interface. They can generate comments, flags,
proposals, and other annotations attached to submissions.</p>
<p>Administrators audit and manage the submission platform, including the
behavior of automated processes and policies, through an administrative
interface.</p>
<p>Authors may also submit papers via authorized third-party interfaces, which
integrate with arXiv via HTTP APIs exposed by the arXiv API gateway. API
clients may deposit submissions in bulk (e.g. conference proceedings), or on
an individual basis acting directly on behalf of an arXiv user. Submissions
handled by clients operated by trusted partners may be handled differently than
submissions originating from the arXiv submission interface, as dictated by
arXiv policies.</p>

<div class="section" id="submission-database">
<span id="id1"></span><h3>Submission database<a class="headerlink" href="#submission-database" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The submission database (currently MySQL) is responsible for operational and
core descriptive metadata about submissions. Operational metadata includes
information related to arXiv workflows and processes. Core descriptive
metadata are the core publication metadata fields required for arXiv
submissions (e.g. title, authors, abstract). The primary source of truth
for the state of each submission is a set of transformation events.
Derivative representations (e.g. of submission objects) are also stored for
querying and rapid access.</p>
<p>In early phases of the classic renewal process, this will be the classic MySQL
database running in the CUL-IT datacenter. Upon migration to the cloud, this
will be replaced; likely with a PostgresQL database running in AWS RDS.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="core-interface-services">
<h3>Core interface services<a class="headerlink" href="#core-interface-services" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>These services provide the core submission, moderation, and administrative
interfaces for the arXiv submission system. Each of these services integrates
with the <a class="reference internal" href="#submission-database"><span class="std std-ref">Submission database</span></a> to modify submission state, via the
<a class="reference internal" href="#submission-core-events-package"><span class="std std-ref">Submission core events package</span></a>.</p>
<p>Asynchronous operations (e.g. to execute rule-based logic) are performed by a
<span class="xref std std-ref">submission-worker</span> process. Communication between the interface services
and the worker is mediated by a task queue (Redis). Tasks passed on the queue
are implemented in the <a class="reference internal" href="#submission-core-events-package"><span class="std std-ref">Submission core events package</span></a> using
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.celeryproject.org/">Celery</a>.</p>
<p>These core interface services integrate with other services in the submission
system (e.g. <a class="reference internal" href="#file-management-service"><span class="std std-ref">File management service</span></a>, <a class="reference internal" href="#compilation-service"><span class="std std-ref">Compilation service</span></a>) via
their HTTP APIs.</p>
<div class="section" id="submission-core-events-package">
<span id="id2"></span><h4>Submission core events package<a class="headerlink" href="#submission-core-events-package" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>This package provides an event-based Python API for CRUD operations on
submissions and submission-related (meta)data. Services (below) that operate
on submission data do so via this abstraction, which integrates with the
<a class="reference internal" href="#submission-database"><span class="std std-ref">Submission database</span></a></p>
<p>Rather than perform CRUD operations directly on submission objects, all
operations that modify submission data are performed through the creation of
submission events. This ensures that we have a precise and complete record of
activities concerning submissions, an explicit definition of
operations that can be performed within the arXiv submission system, and a
starting-point for building rule-based workflows to support moderation and
administrative tasks.</p>
<p>This package also provides integration with a Kinesis notification broker,
which propagates notifications about events in real time to other services
in the arXiv system (e.g. the <span class="xref std std-ref">webook-notification-service</span>).</p>
<p>To support automated processes, this package also implements a set of
asynchronous tasks using <a class="reference external" href="http://www.celeryproject.org/">Celery</a>. Provides
integration with a task queue (Redis) for message passing.</p>

publication-ready submission package.</p>
