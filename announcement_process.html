<h1>Submission &amp; announcement Process<a class="headerlink" href="#submission-announcement-process" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>This section describes the classic arXiv submission and announcement process at
a high level.</p>
<div class="section" id="submissions-states">
<h2>Submissions &amp; States<a class="headerlink" href="#submissions-states" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>An arXiv submission is comprised of a source package and a collection of
procedural and descriptive metadata. The source package is usually comprised of
a scientific paper (generally in LaTeX) and auxiliary resources (e.g. images,
tables, errata); see <span class="xref std std-ref">supported-source-formats</span>.</p>
<p>The primary objectives of the arXiv submission system are rapid dissemination
of scientific findings, and to support QA/QC workflows for arXiv’s volunteer
moderators and the operations team. For a glimpse into how arXiv submissions
are processed on a daily basis, see <a class="reference external" href="https://blogs.cornell.edu/arxiv/2018/01/19/a-day-in-the-life-of-the-arxiv-admin-team/">this recent blog post</a>.</p>
<p>In support of rapid dissemination, a core requirement for the submission
system is that the daily announcement process should continue
even in the absence of human intervention. In other words, if the moderation
and operations teams were disbanded tomorrow, arXiv would continue to accept
and disseminate e-prints as usual.</p>
<p>At any given time, a submission will be in one of the states described below.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">It should be noted that in the arXiv-NG submission system these states are
defined in terms of the the data that describes the submission, <strong>not</strong> by a
flag in the database.</p>

<dt>Working</dt>
<dd>When the submission process is initiated, it generally lacks some of the
(meta)data and/or content required for announcement. For example, the
submission process may be initiated by sending preliminary information for
only a few metadata fields, leaving the submission source package to be
uploaded separately. Several users and/or API clients may be involved in
contributing information about the submission. The source package must
compile to a usable PDF before a submission can leave the working
state.</dd>
<dt>Processing</dt>
<dd>Once a submission is finalized (ready for announcement), it is subject to
a handful of automated QA/QC checks. For example, we need to be able to
extract plain text content from the compiled paper for subsequent checks.
Depending on the results of those checks, the submission may be bounced
back to the working state to correct problems. Generally, a submission
remains in the processing state for a very short period of time (seconds or
minutes).</dd>
<dt>Submitted</dt>
<dd>If the preliminary checks pass, the submission is considered to be in the
submitted state. Automated checks for technical issues may also be applied
while the submission is in this state, and members of the moderation and
operations teams may inspect the paper for quality or to address issues
flagged by the technical checks. If a moderation flag is applied to the
submission during this process, the submission transitions to the <strong>On
Hold</strong> state (below). If no moderation or administrative flags are raised
on the submission, the submission will automatically transition to the
<strong>Scheduled</strong> state (below) at one of two cutoff times.</dd>
<dt>On Hold</dt>
<dd>A submission in this state has been flagged by a moderator or by an
automated QA/QC process for potential problems. Submissions in this state
are usually inspected by the operations team, who may reach out to the
submission owner. If and when the issues with the submission are resolved,
an administrator will remove the blocking flags from the submission, and
the submission will return to the <strong>Submitted</strong> state.</dd>
<dt>Scheduled</dt>
<dd>Any submissions in the <strong>Submitted</strong> state at the announcement cut-off time
(currently 2PM ET) will be automatically scheduled for announcement on the
same day (currently 8PM ET). Any remaining submissions in the <strong>Submitted</strong>
state at the next-day cutoff (currently 8PM ET) will be scheduled for
announcement on the following day.</dd>
<dt>Announced</dt>
<dd>The automated announcement process runs daily, currently at 8PM ET. Any
submissions scheduled for the current day will be updated with their
arXiv ID and version, and an announcement timestamp. At that time, the
submission is considered <strong>Announced</strong>. No further changes
may be made to a submission in this state.</dd>
